Client Meeting - Project Alpha
Jan 15, 2024

Quick sync with client today about Q1 timeline. They're pushing for March 15 launch instead of end of March. Budget approved at $75k which is great news.

Main concerns:
- Mobile performance needs to be solid
- Want weekly progress updates
- Need final design approval by next week

Technical discussion:
Sarah mentioned the new animation library might cause performance issues on older devices. We agreed to do performance testing early next week. Mike will create test scenarios.

Decisions:
- Moving forward with approach B for the backend architecture
- Weekly client check-ins every Tuesday at 2pm
- Sarah leads frontend, John handles backend integration
- Design review meeting next Wednesday

Action items:
- John needs to finish API documentation by Friday
- Sarah to optimize mobile performance this week
- Mike creates performance test plan by Monday
- Oleg to send weekly update template to client

Risks:
- Tight timeline if we hit any major technical issues
- External API dependency - vendor hasn't confirmed timeline yet
- Team capacity next month (Sarah's vacation)

Next meeting: Next Tuesday 2pm to review progress
